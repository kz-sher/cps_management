# CPS Management System
This project is a small laravel-based inventory management system. In this case, CPS stands for 'Customers', 'Products' and 'Suppliers', which would be the three main entities involved in this management system. As mentioned earlier, this is about managing inventory within the environment established on top of the three entities stated, so having data control is inevitable. Here, CRUD concept is applied, which is `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE`. 

### Additional Lesson Learned
The knowledge that I always ignore is to have a proper step-by-step blueprint before really getting into building the system. It is noticed that `UML Design` is actually very useful for knowing how many databases (technically, tables in MySQL) we should have and how they are going to interact with others.
